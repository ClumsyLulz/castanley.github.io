						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>Why hello there, and welcome to my personal website! So, where to start? I will try to make this pretty easy to read and hopefully not too terribly boring :P
<br><br>
My name is Christopher Alan Stanley, and I have a Masters in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security. Fancy eh? Well, it all started when I was a kid. Growing up, my parents were definitely not the "sporty" type. My dad, at the time, worked for the state doing some IT stuff. We could call him a GEEK, but it wouldn't do him justice! He is a brilliant individual and as such, tried to teach me all that he could. Instead of passing the football out back like a "normal" family, we resorted to hacking away on the computer and writing code. I specifically remember at one point we made our own Space Invaders game in Visual Basic 6. Cool right? I mean, who do you know can say they made a Space Invaders game at age ~10? Haha, in any case that event really was the spark of my interest in the field I am currently pursuing. 
<br><br>
Let's fast forward about 10 years to when I completed my first College Degree. I received an Associate in Applied Science with a focus on Computer Networking. This was around the time when I started my own company Stanley Networks, LLC. At that point, I was extremely interested in Computer Networking and all the fun aspects that came with it. 
<br><br>
A few years later when I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Applied Information Technologies, I realized that I wanted to go in a different direction career wise and shifted my focus to UNIX/Linux Administration. Half way into the Masters program I got my first contract as a Linux Systems Administrator and Security Consultant with Baptist Health Hospital. I was tasked with securing their Apache web servers and patching their RedHat Enterprise Linux boxes. I worked there full-time for about a year before I was offered another contract with the State Government as a UNIX Systems Administrator. 
<br><br>
I am currently working full time for the State as an Enterprise Storage Systems Administrator. After about a year and a half of working with the amazing people on the UNIX team I was offered a position on the Enterprise Storage Team. This was a very different move for me, but I knew that they were looking for help, help which I was confident I could provide. During my time at the state I have had the wonderful pleasure of working with a ton of RedHat, AIX and Solaris servers and I have had a blast playing with and familiarizing myself with all of the different storage platforms. I have also had great success designing and implementing Big Data Analytics Platforms like Splunk and Hadoop. I couldn't ask for a better life. I have a wonderful, beautiful wife and a family I am extremely close to.
<br><br>
I am always looking to expand my network and any help any way possible. If you have any questions or need help with anything please feel free to contact me! My contact information is at the bottom of this page.
<br><br>
If you stuck with me and read this whole summary, then you deserve some internet points haha. Thanks for the interest, and take care :P
